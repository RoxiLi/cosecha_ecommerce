/**
 * A data structure for an item's source.
 *
 * Sources are primarily used to determine how and/or which items should be fetched from an {@link ItemProvider}.
 * Typically, sources will contain information about accounts, categories, collections or other similar item-specific
 * parameters. They may also contain remote-specific information such as URLs, host names, IP addresses, file paths
 * and so-on. However, it is preferable to defer this resolution to an {@link ItemProvider}.
 *
 * Sources should be constructable using static consumer data, meaning they should not contain any functional data
 * such as class instances or callbacks.
 *
 * Item sources as primarily used to determine or distinguish the remote source for items. These can be URLs, host
 * names, IP addresses, file paths, etc.
 *
 * Sources must be able to be uniquely identified via their {@link Source::$key}. This key is most notably used in
 * equivalence checks to determine if an item was fetched from this source or to query for items that were fetched
 * for this source. For reliability, it is advised to generate the key using the uniqueness of a source's data.
 *
 * In contrast, the {@link Source::$type} is treated as a form of "enum" and is used to allow an {@link ItemProvider}
 * to utilize different fetch methods depending on its value.
